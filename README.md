# inkscape-low_poly
Add the files in the extensions folder of your inkscape installation.
For linux add the files to home/.config/inkscape/extensions

## this extension is a cleanup and fork of https://github.com/marcosbses/inkscape-low_poly for InkScape 1.0
It works similar to Voronoi pattern but its more automated to make low poly masks
